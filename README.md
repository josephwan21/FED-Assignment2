Assignment 2 Repository (FED) - Joseph Wan & Timothy Chai

For Assignment 2, we are planning to create an interactive website that offers users a captivating online experience through engaging trivia questions. We aim to captivate users with an interactive game of quizzes, making the experience engaging and enjoyable. Once the user logins or create a new account, they can start a trivia quiz in one of the chosen categories. Each quiz has 10 questions and 5 chances for mistakes before it ends. Each quiz grants the user experience points and trophies, to increase their player level to unlock more things and to rise up the leaderboard respectively. Users can gain various achievements and customise their profile as well.
