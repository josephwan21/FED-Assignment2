Assignment 2 Repository (FED) - Joseph Wan & Timothy Chai

For Assignment 2, we are planning to create an interactive website that offers users a captivating online experience through engaging trivia questions. We aim to captivate users with an interactive game of quizzes, making the experience engaging and enjoyable. Once the user logins or create a new account, they can start a trivia quiz in one of the chosen categories. Each quiz has 10 questions to answer from. Each quiz grants the user experience points and trophies, to increase their player level to unlock more things and to rise up the leaderboard respectively. Users can customise their profile as well.

## Design Process

<h3><strong> User Audience Intent & Purpose</h3></strong>

-   The user audience's intent is to engage in trivia questions of the category they choose, gain experience points, trophies and level up through the Trivia Quest website.
-   Engage user to keep on using the website since it has gamified features such as XP, trophies and level invoking a sense of completion or continuation.

Who the website caters for

-   The website is mainly targeted towards audiences who are interested and would like to test their general knowledge on various categories that they would like to choose from.

What the website caters for

-   The website itself is fairly minimalistic in design, allowing for users to easily navigate through the website with minimal confusion, if not, none.

<h3><strong>User Story</h3></strong>

-   As a user, I would want to find out what the range of topics are that I could choose from.

-   As a user or avid user of the website, I would also want to find out what my current level is and how much experience points I need to level up.

-   As a mobile user, I would want the website to be responsive and easy to navigate/not messy so I can access parts of the website with ease whenever I am on the go.

## Features

-   Gamified features/elements such as having a level and XP which can be increased through doing the quizzes and gaining experience points from them.

-   Hassle-free Profile Editing. Instead of having your usual edit button to edit your profile, users could edit their profile fields on the spot without having to press any sort of 'Edit' button and the updated profile fields get automatically saved to the database.

-   Animations when selecting different categories. There are animations set in place when the user tries to select a particular category 

## Technologies Used

-   HTML (HyperText Markup Language) - Used to set the main structure of the website e.g (header, paragraphs and text and where to place them)

-   CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) - Used to define the style of the website. e.g colour, size, shape of a few elements, background colour etc.

-   JS (JavaScript) - Used for Website Interactivity, fetching API and data from databases

## Credits

<h3><strong>Collaboration</h3></strong>

-   For the assignment, I have done the main structure for the log in page (index.html), applied the blue-green gradient and the trivia page as well (trivia.html). Worked on the Profile modal and the gathering of leaderboard data from the database in the games page (games.html).
-   Special thanks to Timothy Chai for his contributions to the main structure of the games.html page, games.js JavaScript code to set the trivia categories and difficulties up, trivia.js JavaScript file for implementing the fetching of questions from Open Trivia Database and for also noting out my mistakes and issues I have with my code. He has also applied lottie animations for each category in the games.html page and the loading of questions in the trivia.html page.
